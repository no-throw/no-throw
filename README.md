# no-throw

`no-throw` colors every function **throwing** or **non-throwing** and statically
enforces that no throw escapes a non-throwing one.

Throwing is the default; non-throwing is opt-in. You mark a function
`/** @nothrow */` and the tool holds you to it.

```ts
/** @nothrow */
export function fail(): void {
  throw new Error("boom"); // Uncaught `throw` escapes this `@nothrow` function.
}

/** @nothrow */
export function attempt(): void {
  try {
    throw new Error("boom");
  } catch {
    return; // bridged — the throw became a returned value
  }
}
```

**CI is where the guarantee lives; the editor is feedback.**

## Status

This is the walking skeleton. What works today is the mark, the body walk and
the `try`/`catch` bridge for an uncaught `throw`. Unbridged calls, async, the
carrier chain, the standard-library baseline and `nothrow emit` are not built
yet. The design is locked and lives in
[the v1 spec](https://github.com/MidnightDesign/no-throw/issues/30).

## Packages

Three packages in the `@nothrow` npm scope, versioned in lockstep.

| package | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`@nothrow/core`](packages/core) | the engine — color resolution and the escape-site walk |
| [`@nothrow/eslint-plugin`](packages/eslint-plugin) | the ESLint adapter; contains no analysis |
| [`@nothrow/cli`](packages/cli) | the `nothrow` binary; hosts `emit` |

## Working on it

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm test
```

`pnpm test` builds, checks that the packages are in lockstep, and runs the
[conformance suite](conformance) — fixture projects on disk paired with the
diagnostics they must produce. Every behavior lands there.
